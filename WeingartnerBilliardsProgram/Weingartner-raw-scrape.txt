(******************* Program Instructions *****************************************************************)
<B>Basic Introduction: </B><br /><br />The WBP is a series of 76 shots arranged in 19 groups of 4 shots per group. The program carries a similar format to the Artistic Billiard competition, wherein all players shoot the exact same shots, get three tries per shot, and earn points upon successful completion of each shot.<br /><br /><B>Using This Blog</B><br />Use the Shot links in the right sidebar to select pages to view.<br /><br />In each blog page for a shot, there are two pages stored: <br /><br />page 1: the Initial Position<br />page 2: Suggested Solution <br /><br />In the table program, use the page navigation arrows located at the bottom right corner to view two pages for the shot. You can also view them as puzzles. Save your solution onto page 1 and compare it to page 2. This is a great learning experience for everyone.<br /><br />All our suggested solution will be carefully examed by advanced players. More comments will also be made accordingly.<br /><br /><B>Commenting on the shot</B><br />Please feel free to add comments at the end of any page. However please keep the conversation topic only on  the shot so everyone can have a pleasing experience in sharing ideas.<br />For commenting on general issues, you can add it at the end of this page (Program Instruction).<br /><br /><B>Instructions for Play</B><br /><br />- The cue ball used is always the Yellow ball. The driven or first object ball is always the White ball. The score or second object ball is always the Red ball. <br /><br />- Each shot will only count if the 3 balls land and remain in the gathering zone in accordance with the predetermined path. (the gathering zone for every shot is  the green 1 diamond square in each diagram). <br /><br />- Each diagram yields from 4-11 points relative to its complexity and difficulty. Total points for all possible shots is 500. The shot is completed if the balls duplicate the diagram and the billiard is scored in the gathering zone and all balls remain in the gathering zone. <br /><br />- Please note that to kiss is usually considered a mistake and the shot has not been successfully completed. However in selected shots to be noted, a kiss is allowed if it occurs in the gathering zone and in specific kiss-back shots. <br /><br />-The shots as diagrammed are set up for right-handed players. The shots may be set up on the opposite sides of the table to accommodate left-handed players. <br /><br />- Power strokes, whip strokes and masse' shots are not in the programs; the cloth is not abused. <br /><br />-This program was original developed when the standard equipment was ivory balls and heavier wool cloth. With the newer equipment of plastic balls and more sheer worsted wool cloth, several of the shots are very difficult and may not even be possible with brand new cloth and balls.
(******************* Rules for Match Play *****************************************************************)
<B>Rules for Match Play: </B><br /><br />- Each player may try up to 3 times to complete the shot. In the gathering zone, the Cue ball (Yellow) and the first object ball (White) may touch the borders of the zone. <br /><br />- Each player will receive a number by drawing lots. Player number 1 starts with Group 1 and plays all 4 shots in the group. Then each subsequent player plays the Group in turn. Then Player 2 starts Group 2 and so on through Group 18. <br /><br />For Group 19, the players are put in the order of: <br />(1) the highest number of points <br />(2) if a tie, then the fewest total shot attempts <br />(3) if a tie, then the most shots solved (i.e., successful execution) <br />(4) if a tie, then the largest amount of high point value shots <br /><br />- Then for Group 19, the lowest player in the ranking starts and the highest player in the ranking is last. The winner is determined by the same rankings as above.<br /><br /><B>The Shot Program, Groups and Point Assignments:</b><br /><br />In the WBP, each shot is assigned a degree of difficulty by use of point values, where each shot carries a point value between 4 and 11 points. A perfect score for successful execution of all shots is 500 points.<br /><br />Group 1: Ball-to-Ball Draw Shots<br />Shots 1-4: 5, 7, 7, 11 points, 30 total<br /> <br />Group 2: 1-Cushion Draw Shots<br />Shots 5-8: 5, 6, 7, 7 points, 25 total<br /><br />Group 3: 3-Cushion Shots<br />Shots 9-12: 4, 4, 7, 9 points, 24 total<br /><br />Group 4: Follow Shots<br />Shots 13-16: 5, 6, 7, 8 points, 26 total<br /><br />Group 5: 1-Cushion Draw Shots<br />Shots 17-20, 6, 7, 7, 9 points, 29 total<br /><br />Group 6: Rail-First Shots<br />Shots 21-24: 6, 6, 7, 7 points, 26 total<br /><br />Group 7: 2-Cushion Draw Shots<br />Shots 25-28: 7, 8, 9, 10 points, 34 total<br /><br />Group 8: 3-Cushion Shots<br />Shots 29-32: 5, 6, 7, 8 points, 26 total<br /><br />Group 9: Ball-to-Ball Draw Shots<br />Shots 33-36: 6, 6, 7, 7 points, 26 total<br /><br />Group 10: 1-Cushion Shots<br />Shots 37-40: 4, 6, 6, 10 points, 26 total<br /><br />Group 11: 1-Cushion Draw Shots<br />Shots 41-44: 5, 6, 7, 9 points, 27 total <br /><br />Group 12: 2-Cushion Shots<br />Shots 45-48: 5, 6, 6, 10 points, 27 total<br /> <br />Group 13: 1-Cushion Shots<br />Shots 49-52: 4, 5, 5, 9 points, 23 total<br /><br />Group 14: Full Table Follow Shots<br />Shots 53-56: 4, 5, 6, 10 points, 25 total<br /><br />Group 15: Kiss-Time Shots<br />Shots 57-60: 4, 5, 6, 11 points, 26 total<br /><br />Group 16: Dead Ball Draw Shots<br />Shots 61-64: 4, 5, 6, 6 points, 21 total<br /><br />Group 17: Dead Ball Follow Shots<br />Shots 65-68: 4, 6, 6, 10 points, 26 total<br /><br />Group 18: 1-Cushion Shots<br />Shots 69-72: 4, 4, 5, 9 points, 22 total<br /> <br />Group 19: Kiss-Back Shots<br />Shots 73-76: 4, 7, 9, 11 points, 31 total
(******************* Background Info *****************************************************************)
<B>The Original Creator </B><br /><br />Weingartner Billiard Program was created by Mr. Heinrich Weingartner approximately 50 or 60 years ago. According to Mr. Bob Jewett, Mr. Weingartner is still conducting a billiard school in Austria. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.bskunion.at/english/weingartner_e.htm"><B>A link to Mr. Heinrich Weingartner Bio</B></a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.wiener-kaffeehaus.at/07_Museum/7_0_Museum_Detail.asp?SID=235416004155525&ID=9970"><B>A link to Weingartner Billiards Museum</B></a><br /><br /><br /><B>Background</B><br />These are the words by Steve Hegg in the first online adaptation of Weingartner Billiard Program using WeiTable:<br /><br />Through a series of posts, and use of the WEI carom table, I'm going to try and transfer some carom billiard knowledge in something called the "Weingartner Billiard Program," which from here on I'll refer to as the WBP. This information was given to me a few years ago by Eli Castleman, a kind old gentleman that I used to know. Back around '95-'96 when I was first starting out in carom billiards, Eli took me under his wing and showed me a lot of basic concepts and finer points of making gathers in straight rail and balkline carom billiards. He also gave me a copy and translations of the program, which was originally written in German about 50 or 60 years ago. <br /><br />During the past few years, I've shared hard copies of this program with Deno Andrew and other billiard friends that I've come to know. You can gain a good understanding to some basic concepts behind gathering and/or controlling all 3 balls with the precision required for solid play in 3-cushion, straight rail or balkline. Just my opinion, but a lot of this knowledge could transfer over well to some pool games where precise control of driven balls (e.g., 1-pocket, 9-ball safety play, etc.) <br /><br />Also, you can use it to walk over to any carom billiard table, set up the shots, and see what kind of stroke you really have. It is also a lot of fun and possibly could be used in part or whole for some internet-based competition across the continents. <br /><br />I think one of the most important concepts of the program is the relative simplicity of the strokes required. The WBP specifically states the power strokes, whip strokes and masse' shots are not in the program and that the cloth is not abused. So if you try any of the shots, you don't need to use any fancy technique, just a good solid stroke. Shots in this program, and other similar shots, are personally satisfying for me, because I like the great charge that I get when I can make all 3 balls do exactly what I want them to do. I get much more satisfaction out of making a precise straight rail gather than I do from some fancy multiple rail trick shot for 3-cushion billiards. <br /><br />Also, it has been a "labor of love" for me. One of my goals in billiards is to find "old knowledge" that has been lost or misplaced over the years, and share it with people who are interested. So many years ago during the golden age of billiards, there were many people would could teach and execute the shots in this program, as well as all of the other skills necessary to become a great player in straight rail or balkline. These people are all but non-existent in the USA today. I would hope than one day, we could again have a solid teaching program for carom billiards once again, like there is in Europe. <br /><br />By making these shots generally available, anyone so inclined can at least get a feel for many of the basic gather shots and strokes required for these games. There is, after all, only 1 correct way to make each shot. Also, I think there is a lot that can be learned from these shots on a billiard table and transferred over to the various pocket games. Maybe someday, there will be enough interest to have an internet-based competition, like others have done with Fargo and Equal Offense. <br /><br />As you can see, all 19 groups of shots for the 76 shot Weingartner Billiard Program, are complete and available for everyone in the newsgroup. I want to thank WEI for creating the table and the scripting program to make all of this possible. Also thanks to Guy in France who has e-mailed a lot of feedback to me about his interest in the program. One other note is that all the diamond lines and balk lines can be drawn on the table with a small piece of tailor's chalk.

Another interesting thing to note is that these 3-cushion shots and the other 3 cushion shots that will be shown in Group 8, have relatively low point values as compared to many other shots.<br /><br />This is consistent of the thinking of many others and myself, in that playing good straight rail or balkline billiards is much more difficult than it seems, and playing good 3-cushion billiards is not as difficult as it seems.<br /><br />I hope this helps to motivate you to go out and try to play some 3-cushion billiards.
